No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate, including this theme. So we should only write standard markdown. I like `[[WikiLink]]`, but I love standard markdown more. So we should always use standard markdown link `[text](https://example.com)`, or use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions), and don't use any vendor locked-in feature. That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.\n\n2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.\n\n3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### New Wiki\n\n1.

(I still can’t take more than 200mg without getting a sharp hot flush and itchy rash.)\n- 100mg B2 three times a day (I only take 200mg B2 a day, and it turns my pee neon yellow.)\n- 1/2 teaspoon unprocessed sea salt added to the diet. It’s very important to use unrefined salt, as table salt is refined, which means essential minerals have been removed.\n### Salt Loading\n- Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of unrefined, unprocessed sea salt or Himalayan salt in about 4 fluid ounces or half a cup of warm water.\n- Follow this immediately with 12-16oz of pure water.\n- This should trigger copious urination – if not, repeat in 30-45 minutes, and repeat again if necessary.\n### Iodine Intake\n- starting with 12.5mg of iodine (such as Iodorol, Iodorx or Lugol’s) each day, and increasing the dose by 12.5mg every week.\n## Pulse Dosing\n- Many people who undergo the Iodine Protocol cease taking iodine for 48 hours every week, but continue with the salt loading and taking the companion nutrients during this time. This is known as “pulse-dosing” and it can help alleviate the detox symptoms.\n## Clearing Chlorine Blocks\n- Drinking Water\n\t- Binchotan charcoal is said to remove elements like chlorine from water by attracting the negative ions to the surface of the charcoal. It also neutralises the water’s pH levels.\n\t- After three months of use, the stick has to be boiled in water for 10 minutes, after which it can be used again for a further three months.\n- Shower & Bath Filters\n\t- https://www.pureshowers.co.uk/bath-ball-bath-filter.html\n\t- You have to swoosh it around the bath for three minutes before getting in. It lasts for 12 months or up to 400 baths.\n## Clearing Mercury Blocks\n\n\n# Support Minerals\n- Selenium is necessary for the production of powerful antioxidants such as glutathione.\n- A lack of selenium (selenium deficiency) may set you up for inflammation in the thyroid gland if you are also using iodine.\n- As long as you replete your selenium (and zinc and other nutrient deficiencies) before you take iodine this shouldn't be an issue.\n- In addition to this, you should carry out the Salt Loading Protocol twice a day while detox symptoms continue. This is a very important part of the detoxification process.\n\n# Best Dosage\n- http://dropulator.com/old/\n- For 70-80% of thyroid patients (especially those who are supplementing regularly with zinc and selenium) then starting out in the **6mg to 12.5mg** range shouldn't pose any problem. I would recommend 1 capsule per day of a supplement such as this which contains both iodide and iodine. \n  If you have experienced issues with iodine in the past or you are sensitive to small doses of medications and supplements then you will want to start out with 100mcg per day and slowly increase your dose over time. You should still be able to get to higher doses over time but it may take a while. \n  At this time I have no recommendations for using doses of iodine higher than **12.5mg** per day.\n## Low Dose\n- Some people are just taking tiny amounts of iodine, possibly with or without supporting nutrients, and staying there at 100’s of mcg, that’s it.\n- Getting tiny amounts of iodine and other nutrients may be better than nothing. But some people are using pretty large amounts of iodine and other nutrients for years in order to clean out some potent toxicities. Starting iodine at these lower doses and hanging out here for a few months may help prepare our cells for more cleaning with more iodine, but staying at tiny doses isn’t going to do much against the toxicities we face today.\n\n\n## Medium Dose\n- Dosage\n\t- The guidelines are to build up the intake of iodine gradually, starting with 12.5mg of iodine (such as Iodorol, Iodorx or Lugol’s) each day, and increasing the dose by 12.5mg every week.\n\t- a daily dose of between 12 and 50mg a day for iodine deficient adults\n\t- There are several reasons to suggest that high doses of iodine in the 6mg to 12.5mg range are healthy, safe, and effective.\n\t- There are studies from certain populations of Japanese (8) which show that these populations consume anywhere from 1 milligrams to 12 milligrams of iodine every day (depending on which study you look at) and have low rates of breast cancer (9) (where iodine concentrates) and thyroid disease.\n\t- Mainland Japanese people are believed to consume approximately 13.8mg of iodine daily, more than 10 times the WHO recommended dose, mainly from seaweed. The Japanese have relatively low levels of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers, and Japanese women have significantly lower levels of fibrocystic breast disease.\n\t- Even if you opt to use higher doses of iodine (in the 6mg to 12.5mg range) you don't have to use it every day.\n\t- You can break up your dose to obtain an average smaller dose simply by taking it once per week or on some similar schedule.\n\t- Once a week dosing with 12.5mg of iodine will provide your body with an average dose of 1.7mg per day of iodine.\n\t- Once per month dosing of 12.5mg of iodine will provide your body with an average dose of around 400mcg of iodine each day.\n\t- My wife on the other hand, who does have thyroid disease, takes the same supplement which contains 12.5mg of iodine each and every day.\n- Experience\n\t- I started the supporting nutrients for about a week, and then I tried 1 drop of Lugols 2% on my forearm. I waited about 24 hours just to see how my body responded. Then I started 1 drop of 2% in a glass of water per day. Then each week, I added 1 drop of 2% to my daily.\n\t- Anytime I ran into detox, I would pause iodine and look for nutrients that helped me with whatever symptoms I was feeling. This was working great, but then I tried high dose..\n\t- A few months into this at about 35mg of daily iodine, I started getting the same symptoms that lead me to iodine. I panicked a bit because I didn’t like the way those symptoms make me feel. Without knowing what else to do, I tried the community’s suggestions of higher doses of iodine.\n\t- Over the course of almost 2 weeks, I consumed close to 2,000mg of iodine total. I wasn’t feeling better and continued to feel off, so I stopped. 3 days later I woke up feeling like I was hit by a bus. Long story short, I dislodged a ton of mainly mercury. I laid on the couch assuming I was dying for a week, and then happened to eat 6 hard-boiled eggs one night and woke up the next morning feeling 80% better. This led me to realize mainly the sulfur and zinc in the eggs bound to the mercury I knocked loose with iodine and allowed me to digest/clear it. For the next month, I used epsom salt and black sesame seeds for sulfur and zinc etc, and had to be careful how much I would take or my butt would burn too much from the metals being passed.\n\t- I was lucky to find the nutrients that happened to work for acute poisoning from high dose iodine knocking loose a hidden toxicity.\n\t- So now, what I think makes the most sense for increasing my iodine levels, is only getting as much iodine as my body can currently handle the detox of. I listen to the detox symptoms and use them to find the nutrition my body is asking for, instead of blasting past it with high dose, which only seems to wrap it up in fat temporarily till we stop taking iodine daily.\n\n\n## High Dose\n- Dosage\n\t- Very high doses of iodine would include doses that range from 25 mg (milligrams per day) all the way up to 50 mg (milligrams) per day.\n\t- The medium doses of iodine are sufficient to help with repletion and should be preferred over very high doses of iodine.\n\t- The general idea of high-dose is starting at 50mg of Lugols. But even starting above 12.5mg is still a pretty high.\n- Experience\n\t- I have a feeling high-dose iodine is able to dislodge toxins via additional gene activity as well as apoptosis and wrap them in fat. I think as we continue to take that amount of iodine, we’re able to hold onto those toxins suspended in fat. This may come in handy at clearing a specific issue, possibly helping us clean up situations that are draining our energy or could otherwise require invasive interventions.\n\t- But we’re carrying around these toxins to begin with because we don’t have the nutrients to run the cells to detox the toxins, and although we’ve stripped them out with iodine and have them suspended in fat, we still don’t have the ability to process them and get them out.\n\t- At this point we’re temporarily suspending toxins in fat, which is great if its helping us feel better, but we need to get this stuff out. Some of us do not seem to be able to wrap toxins in fat at all or for long. Some people using high doses are fine for several months, and then they’re body drops the toxins it’s been suspending and the person feels horrible without understanding why.\n\t- Getting this stuff out requires either working with someone that can help us, or studying how our body works well enough that we’re able to reverse engineer our symptoms. By understanding how to support our body’s ability to generate enough glutathione, we should find areas of our metabolism that are familiar to us as we pay attention to how our own system works. I have laid out most of what has helped me recover my own health here sickoftired.com\n\n\n## Pulse Dosing\n- Pulse Dosing is the idea that we figure out how much our body wants of a specific nutrient. It also allows our body to use up the nutrients so levels can come back down, avoiding potentially getting a bit too much of certain nutrients.\n- Over time, I realized I only need to take a 200mcg selenomethionine two to four times a month. If I take it less than that, I start to feel symptoms, and if I take it much more than that, I feel symptoms of overload. I recently tried a different form of selenium, which is only 50mcg, so I take it every few days.\n- On average, I only take about 6mg of iodine daily and don’t even take it every single day. And then once a week or so, I’ll take a larger dose of 20 or 50mg just to see how my body responds.\n- This is similar to watering houseplants. If we don’t water them, they dry up. If we water them too much, they leak or become waterlogged. But with practice and observation, we can find the sweet spot in the middle. More about Pulse Dosing at whyiodine.com/pulse-dosing\n\n# Side Effects\n- These side effects do not mean that you need to stop using iodine but they may be an indication that you should back off on your dose.\n- Low doses of iodine don't seem to have a strong effect on the thyroid gland but higher doses may start to impact both thyroid function and your thyroid gland.\n- The thyroid gland has a protective mechanism built-in which blocks the update of excessive doses of iodine to prevent states of hyperthyroidism.\n- Moderately high doses of iodine can trigger this response and may explain specific changes in thyroid function in the short term.\n- But just because this can happen doesn't mean you should be scared of it occurring.\n- Even when it does occur this effect tends to be minimal.\n- In addition, and at least in my experience, you are much more likely to experience positive side effects (such as an increased production of thyroid hormone) as opposed to negative side effects.\n- Other side effects with iodine use may include:\n\t- Fatigue\n\t  Nausea\n\t  Rashes/hives\n\t  Sensation that your thyroid is swollen (if this occurs you should stop iodine supplementation)\n\t  These side effects can and should be minimal if you are using appropriate doses of iodine but you should be aware of them.\n\t- The side effects listed above tend to stem from the thyroid gland directly.\n- But it is my opinion that taking iodine by mouth may also have a direct impact on existing thyroid hormone that is already produced in your body.\n- This may be why some individuals who take iodine notice an almost immediate improvement in their symptoms.\n- The reason that this may occur is probably related to the structure of iodine and how it may displace other halides which share a similar electron outer shell.\n- It has been theorized (but not proven to my knowledge) that halides (bromine, chlorine, fluorine) may displace iodine on thyroid hormones molecules.\n- This may happen because all of these chemicals contain a similar electrical charge.\n- Normally, each thyroid hormone contains 4 (for thyroxine) or 3 (for triiodothyronine) iodine molecules on it.\n- But you can imagine that, in some instances, one or more of these iodine molecules may be displaced by these other chemicals.\n- If that occurs they may render the thyroid hormone molecule inactive which would then cause a mismatch between your thyroid lab tests and your clinical presentation.\n- Imagine if even a small number of thyroid molecules in your body were inactive.\n- Your lab tests might show that your serum levels of T4 and T3 were normal but they wouldn't be able to tell you how well these molecules are working.\n- By giving yourself iodine, in supplement form, you could create an environment where these halides might be displaced from thyroid hormone molecules and render them active again due to competitive binding.\n- If this occurs (and I believe there's good reason to believe it does) then the use of iodine could almost instantly improve thyroid function in your body through this mechanism.\n- When I used high doses of iodine I noticed breakouts in my skin that would appear and quickly disappear within a day or so.\n- And these skin changes were consistent with a condition known as bromoderma which is what occurs when your body eliminates excess bromide (a halide).\n- When it does occur I've seen patients tend to experience a quick rush of negative symptoms (flu-like symptoms, breakouts, acne, feeling fatigued, and so on) as the body attempts to eliminate these halides out.\n- So if you've ever experienced these symptoms while taking iodine it may actually be a good thing related to a detox-like reaction and not a negative side effect or even a reason to stop using iodine.\n\n\n# Citations\n- https://www.restartmed.com/high-dose-iodine/\n- https://whyiodine.com/how-much-iodine/\n- http://www.freethinkinghealth.com/features/the-high-dose-iodine-protocol/\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/02) Nutrition/Minerals/","title":"Minerals"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nchild: '[[Iodine]]'\n---\n\n\n#food #minerals\n\n\n[[Iodine]]\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/02) Nutrition/Protein/","title":"Protein"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Food]]'\n\n---\n\n\n- ![image.png](../assets/image_1656477270651_0.png)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/03) Energy/Energy/","title":"Energy"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nchild: \n- '[[Fire]]'\n- '[[Electric]]'\n---\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/03) Energy/Fire/","title":"Survival"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n\n- #

For example, garlic contains 754 ppm of germanium, ginseng contains 250-320 ppm, comfrey contains 152 ppm, and aloe vera 77 ppm. Germanium plays a key role in the circulation of oxygen to the body’s tissues, and stimulates our natural killer (NK) cells which help fight and prevent cancer.

It is also composed of Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, which are hated by parasites and bacteria. Tapeworms, specifically hate cucumbers.\n\n## Roots\n- #Ginger\n- #Tumeric\n\t-  promotes circulation, rekindles the digestive fire, purifies the blood, clears congestion and nourishes the tissues including the brain\n\t- completely inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, as well as a number of other fungal strains, stops Candida from adhering to human cells, performing with greater efficacy than the commercial antifungal drug fluconazole.

Incorporating pineapples into your diet helps to slowly erode the protective layer of these bugs so that they are easier for your immune system to fight and eliminate.\n\t-  bromelain-rich fresh pineapple juice is able to decrease production of the proinflammatory cytokines that lead to colon inflammation\n\t- Because bromelain is a protein-digesting enzyme (proteolytic), it is also an extremely valuable digestive aid that helps us break down protein foods. When the protein you eat is not properly broken down into amino acids (which would be the case in those with low HCL or insufficient digestive enzymes), you’re missing out on key building blocks that act as precursors for neurotransmitters.\n- #Papaya\n\t- adds significant fiber to your body to sweep away many parasites that cling to the walls of the intestines.\n\t- contains papain, digestive enzymes, which condition the tummy making it hostile to bacteria and parasite.\n- #Papaya_Seeds\n\t- the seeds of papaya contains more papain than the flesh\n\t- highly rich in anti-helminthic and anti-amoebic properties that effectively protect your body from many parasites.\n\t- more effective when consumed in conjunction with honey.\n- #Coconut\n- #Coconut_Oil \n\t- Virgin coconut oil [has Lauric and fatty acids](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coconut-oil/#:~:text=Fat%20is%20made%20up%20of,to%20raise%20harmful%20LDL%20levels.) which are dubbed as a very good anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic. \n\t- medium-chain-fatty acids are able to  destroy candida (harmful yeast)  and kill the intestinal parasite Giardia, which is responsible for causing diarrhea. ([15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15991042))\n\t- Virgin coconut oil when ingested raw will cleanse your throat, digestive tract, and colon. This will also serve as a lubricant to your body giving the worms some difficulties in attaching to the linings of the intestines.\n- Berries\n\t- #Blueberry, #Strawberry, and #Blackberry\n\t- researchers believe that berries could get rid of the parasites due to the help of another compound in berries - ellagitannin.\n- #Pomegranite\n\n## Other\n- #Kefir\n- #Sauerkraut\n- #Apple_Cider_Vinegar\n\t- contains B-vitamins\n\n\n## Herbs\n\n### #Wormwood\n\n##### Effects\n- as sesquiterpene lactones, which weakens the parasite’s membrane making them confused and weak\n- Beats Malaria - Artemisinin is an extract isolated from Wormwood - the most powerful antimalarial on the market.  it reacts with the high levels of iron in the parasite to produce free radicals. The free radicals then destroy the cell walls of the malaria parasite. [~](https://draxe.com/nutrition/wormwood/)\n- Fights Cancer Cells - artemisinin can battle iron-enriched breast cancer cells similar to the way it eliminates malaria-causing parasites. Cancer cells can also be rich in iron since they commonly soak it up to facilitate cell division. The normal cells showed little change, but within 16 hours, almost all of the cancer cells were dead and only a few normal cells were killed.\n- \n##### Recipe\n###### Tea\n- Steep a half teaspoon to one teaspoon of dried or fresh wormwood in one cup of boiling water for five to 15 minutes.\n- It’s important that you use no more than one teaspoon of the leaves as they’re very strong and bitter. Longer steep time will make for a stronger wormwood tea, but also a more bitter tea.\n- Wormwood tea should be taken unsweetened to have the best effect, but you can counter the bitterness by adding dried peppermint or anise.\n\n\n- #Clove\n\t- help break down the protective coating that cover intestinal worm eggs\n### #Thyme\n- Effects\n- Recipes\n\t- #Internal_Parasites\n\t\t- 1 Bunch Fresh OR 1 oz powdered\n\t\t- 1 pint water\n\t\t- Bring to boil, then remove from heat\n\t\t- Steep for 15 Minutes\n\t\t- Strain\n\t\t- 8 oz doses twice a day\n\t- #External_Parasites #first-aid\n\t\t- 4 oz powdered\n\t\t- 1 pint alcohol\n\t\t- Steep 2-4 weeks\n\t\t- Strain\n\t\t- Soak gauze/cotton + apply\n- #Red_Clover - Cleanse Blood\n- #Milk_Thistle - Liver + Digestive Cleansing\n- #Dandelion - Liver + Digestive Cleansing\n- #Knotweed Extract\n\n- #Sage Leaf\n- #Gentian Root\n- Hyssop Leaf\n- Fenugreek Seed\n- Chamomile Flower Extract\n- Black Pepper Fruit\n- Peppermint Leaf\n- Fennel\n- Cholorphyll\n- Diatomaceous Earth\n- #Neem\n- \n\n## Avoid\n-   Added sugar – Can feeds harmful organisms in the gut and contribute to inflammation.\n-   Processed foods – Do not support immune health and may be hard to break down.\n-   Alcohol – Does not allow for proper immune system functioning.\n-   Wheat – Many grains, especially those containing gluten, can break down into sugar quickly and cause intestinal inflammation.\n-   Pork – Can potentially be contaminated with parasites.\n\n\n## Smoothie\n[Source](https://superfoodprofiles.com/papaya-seeds-parasites)\n#### Ingredients\n- fresh **papaya seeds** - 1 Tablespoon to 1/4 Cup\n- **papaya** - 1/3 of small or 1/5 of large - 1 Cup \n\t- Ideally you’d be looking for a fruit that is just turning from green to yellow, with green more predominant. Papaya like these should still contain useful levels of digestive enzymes\n- **raw organic pumpkin seeds** - 1/4 Cup\n- **Sunflower Seeds** (optional - 1/2 Cup)\n- **organic virgin coconut oil** - 1 Tablespoon\n\t- The lauric acid in coconuts is converted to the compound monolaurin in the digestive tract, which can help rid the body of protozoa, ringworm and giardia parasites\n- **Desiccated coconut** - 1 Heaping Tablespoon\n\t- If have a fresh coconut, use the **coconut water** instead of plain water\n-  **fresh cloves** - 6 cloves\n\t- Clove oil capsules taken at the same time as the smoothie may also work but I think fresh cloves are better. It can also be good to pre-soak them in a small amount of your smoothie liquid, along with the papaya seeds, before you blend.\n- **Tumeric Powder** - 1 Teaspoon\n- **Ice** - 1/2 Cups\n- **Yogurt** (optional) - 3 Heaping Tablespoons\n\t- eases the taste + strength of cloves\n- **healthy ‘milk’** of your choice - half as high as the rest of the ingredients - 1.5-2.5 Cups\n\t- Ideally use **coconut water** or **half coconut milk and half water**. Coconut is good for parasites and using it for your smoothie’s milk as well increases its effectiveness.\n- Drink the whole smoothie down in one sitting if you can. first thing in the morning on an empty stomach before food. intended to be a breakfast replacement.\n- initial treatment - three or even four mornings in a row\n- repeat the treatment in two weeks time and again in another two weeks\n\t- this is to coincide with the breeding cycles of common parasites, such as tapeworms, hookworms and pinworms.\n\t- By repeating the treatment three times over a 6 week period there’s a much better chance of interrupting this breeding cycle, or up to 3 months to be completely sure that you have dealt with intestinal worms and other kinds of parasites at their various life cycles.\n- #### Laxative\n\t- Ayurvedic triphala powder, [like this organic one I take](https://amzn.to/37Zgdx7), is one of the few truly beneficial laxatives for occasional use.\n\t- You can make it up at the same time as the smoothie and let it sit for a couple of hours to increase its effectiveness.\n\t- Follow the directions for the stronger dose in the page on [taking triphala for digestive health](https://superfoodprofiles.com/how-to-take-triphala-churna \"How to Take Triphala Churna for Digestive Health\") and drink it around two hours after you finish the smoothie and before eating anything else.\n\t- no laxatives should be taken for more than five days in a row. Triphala is fine at the lower doses for longer term use.\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/06) First Aid/First Aid/","title":"First Aid"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Area of Interest]]'\n---"},{"fields":{"slug":"/07) Tools/Tools/","title":"Tools"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Area of Interest]]'\n---"},{"fields":{"slug":"/08) Navigation/Navigation & Time/","title":"Navigation & Time"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Area of Interest]]'\nchild: \n- '[[Navigation & Time/Sky]]'\n- '[[Navigation & Time/Stars]]'\n- '[[Navigation & Time/Earth]]'\n- '[[Navigation & Time/Time]]'\n---\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/08) Navigation/Sky/","title":"Sky"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n\n-\n- #### Degrees\n\t- images\n\t\t- ![[Sky-1657611258366.jpeg]]\n\t\t- \n\t\t- \n\t\t-\n\t\t"},{"fields":{"slug":"/09) Equipment/Equipment/","title":"Equipment"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Area of Interest]]'\n---"},{"fields":{"slug":"/10) Clothing/Clothing/","title":"Clothing"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Area of Interest]]'\nchild: '[[Single Cloth]]'\n---\n#clothing\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/10) Clothing/Single Cloth/","title":"Single Cloth"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n\n## swim suit\nimages\n\t\t![image.png](../assets/image_1656479324154_0.png)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/11) Building/Building/","title":"Building"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Area of Interest]]'\nchild: '[[Whitling]]'\n---\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/11) Building/Whitling/","title":"Whitling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n\n\n#### Trystick\nImages\n\t\t![image.png](../assets/image_1656478916153_0.png)\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/ӿCategories/Area of Interest/","title":"Area of Interest"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\naliases: [Area, Area of Interest]\nparent: '[[Category]]'\nchild:\n- '[[Water]]'\n- '[[Food]]'\n- '[[Energy]]'\n- '[[Shelter]]'\n- '[[Medicine]]'\n- '[[First Aid]]'\n- '[[Tools]]'\n- '[[Navigation & Time]]'\n- '[[Equipment]]'\n- '[[Building]]'\n- '[[Clothing]]'\n---\n#SpecialPage \n```breadcrumbs\ntype:tree\ndir:down\ntitle:false\n```\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/ӿCategories/Category/","title":"Category"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\n\nchild: \n- '[[Level]]' \n- '[[Area of Interest]]'\n---\n#SpecialPage \n\n```breadcrumbs\ntype:tree\ndir:down\ndepth: -2\ntitle:false\n```\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/ӿSpecial Pages/Contents/","title":"Pages"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nchild: \n- '[[Category]]'\n- '[[Resources]]'\n- '[[Glossary]]'\n---\n\n\n```breadcrumbs\ntype:tree\ndir:down\ntitle:false\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n# Pages\n\n[[Volume Conversions]]\n[[Parasite Cleanse]]\n\n\n\n# Glossary\n[[Iodine]]\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/02) Nutrition/Recipe/For Energy/","title":"For Energy"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nparent: '[[Recipe]]'\n---\n#energy #food #recipe #coffee #mct #brain #brainfood\n\n- ## Brain Power\n\t- ### Bulletproof Coffee\n\t\t- **Ingredients**\n\t\t\t- 1 cup strong, high-quality coffee\n\t\t\t\t**- Replaceable with**\n\t\t\t\t- 2–3 tea bags organic green tea\n\t\t\t\t- 1 tsp organic matcha green tea powder (more or less depending on preferred strength)\n\t\t\t\t- 2 cups hot strong-brewed organic black tea\n\t\t\t\t- 2–4 tbsp loose leaf yerba mate\n\t\t\t- 1–2 tbsp MCT Oil (preferably Brain Octane)\n\t\t\t- 1–2 tbsp unsalted, grass-fed butter\n\t\t\t- Stevia, Honey, Maple Syrup for sweetener\n\t\t- **Optional Ingredients** (not all at once, just ideas)\n\t\t\t- 1-2 tbsp Great Lakes Gelatin/Collagen\n\t\t\t- ½ tsp cinnamon\n\t\t\t  ¼ tsp sea salt\n\t\t\t- ½ cup filtered water\n\t\t\t  ½ cup coconut milk\n\t\t\t- ¼ tsp vanilla extract\n\t\t\t  2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder\n\t\t\t- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon (to taste)\n\t\t\t  ¼ tsp ground ginger (to taste)\n\t\t\t  1 tsp honey or a few drops of Stevia\n\t\t\t- Stevia, cinnamon, ginger, and/or curcuma to taste\n\t\t- Why\n\t\t\t- MCT Oil\n\t\t\t\t- MCTs are a particular kind of fat requiring less energy and fewer enzymes to break down for digestion, compared to other fats and sugar.\n\t\t\t\t- What this means is that you get the nutrients into your system in far fewer steps than you would from even a piece of toast. MCT oil is also good for your gut (2) , it has anti-microbial properties, and it curbs hunger and cravings.\n\t\t\t\t- MCT can assist in mild weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight. Best of all, MCTs convert to energy on a cellular level without having to process through your liver, which keeps your liver healthy and clean!\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t- How\n\t\t\t- BLEND\n\t\t\t- Remember, oil and water do not blend naturally, so adding butter and oil to your coffee will make it look like an oil liner spilled in the Pacific.
